# Car Price Prediction Using Linear Regression

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting car prices using a linear regression model. The dataset contains various car attributes that influence pricing, such as brand, model, mileage, year of manufacture, and other relevant factors.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Building and training a Linear Regression model
- Evaluating model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/car-price-prediction.git
   cd car-price-prediction
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Then, open the `car-price-prediction-using-linear-regression.ipynb` file.

## Usage
- Run the notebook cells step by step to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
- Modify the dataset or features to see how the model responds.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training the model contains attributes such as:
- Car brand & model
- Year of manufacture
- Mileage
- Engine size
- Fuel type
- Transmission type
- Selling price

## Model Performance
The performance of the linear regression model is evaluated using:
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures average squared differences between actual and predicted values.
- **R-squared Score**: Indicates how well the independent variables explain the variability in car prices.

## Future Improvements
- Experiment with other machine learning models (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Feature engineering to improve model accuracy
- Deploy the model as a web application
